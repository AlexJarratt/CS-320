I can ensure that my code, program, or software is both functional and secure by testing it. Testing the code can be done by making an additional file that takes the code of the original and inserts values. Furthermore, this testing should throw the values that cannot occur in the code. I can interpret user needs and incorporate them into the program by taking user ideas and building them in the code. If a user has a good idea then I can take the idea and build a set of systems that enhance the overall program. However I cannot take an idea and incorporate it if the coding system is not capable of producing such a idea. I approach designing software as a necessary part of making working and effective code. For the most part, my coding has not needed too much of software design as I simply work to the requirements that are tasked of me. However, this will not work in the real world as there is a lot of different ways one could go about a singluar requirement, unlike these classes. Thus, I will need to eventually change my approach to software design.
